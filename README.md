## The notebook where I implemented the Transformer Architecture using Neel Nanda's Google Colab template. 

However, there are couple of problems. Although the Google colab link works, which one can find here - https://colab.research.google.com/gist/SanzharBissenali/90dbc16ce38ff36be9c86885fd26c20f/-clean_transformer_demo_template-ipynb.ipynb, 
the Github can't load it. The other problem I discovered after implementation is that, some of the libraries (TorchLens) was updated, and the test functions have to be rewritten.
